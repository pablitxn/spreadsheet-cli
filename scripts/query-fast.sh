# Example queries for expanded_dataset_moved.xlsx:
# 1. What is the total Quantity for SecurityID 101121101 across the dataset?
# 2. What is the average TotalBaseIncome for rows with PaymentType 'DIV'?
# 3. What is the maximum TotalBaseIncome observed in the dataset?
# 4. Which SecurityID contributes the highest aggregate TotalBaseIncome?
# 5. How many unique PaymentType values are present?
# 6. What is the average Quantity for SIMON PROPERTY GROUP INC entries?
# 7. What is the total TotalBaseIncome for SecurityGroup 1?
# 8. What percentage of rows have Quantity greater than 1000?
# 9. What is the earliest ExDate in the dataset?
# 10. What is the TotalBaseIncome-to-Quantity ratio for SecurityID 828806109?
# 11. For which SecurityGroup is the variance of Quantity the highest, and what is that variance?
# 12. What is the difference between the median Quantity of DIV payments and the median Quantity of ACTUAL payments (DIV âˆ’ ACTUAL)?
# 13. What is the ratio of the total TotalBaseIncome of ACTUAL rows to that of DIV rows?
# 14. What is the 90th percentile (P90) of Quantity across the dataset?
# 15. Which SecurityID shows the greatest standard deviation of TotalBaseIncome, and what is that standard deviation?
# 16. Which SecurityGroup derives the largest share of its TotalBaseIncome from DIV payments, and what is that share?
# 17. What is the average daily TotalBaseIncome over the full range of ExDates (earliestâ†’latest, inclusive)?
# 18. How many rows record a negative TotalBaseIncome?
# 19. For SecurityID 101121101, what is the coefficient of variation of Quantity (std Ã· mean)?
